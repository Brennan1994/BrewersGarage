    <h1>Brewer's Garage</h1>
    <p>Brewer's Garage is a simple homebrew calculator. It intends to simplify the process of preparing a beer for brewing without all the unnecessary bells and whistles other tools offer. Beer is science, but good beer is art. Spend your time on the parts that matter, and leave the science to the nerds.</p>
